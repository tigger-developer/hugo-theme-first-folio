# Frontmatter Reference

Every content page in Hugo uses YAML frontmatter (between `---` markers) to control how it is displayed. This reference covers all frontmatter fields supported by the First Folio theme.

---

## Basic fields

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
date: 2026-01-15
draft: true
description: "Short description for cards and metadata"
author: "Author Name"
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | yes | Page title. Displayed in headings, cards, browser tab. |
| `date` | yes | Publication date. Used for sorting and display. |
| `draft` | no | `true` hides the page from production builds. |
| `description` | no | Short text shown on masonry cards. Defaults to Hugo's auto-summary if not set. |
| `author` | no | Author name. Displayed on article pages and cards. |
| `tags` | no | List of tags for taxonomy. |

---

## Layout

Controls how the article page is rendered.

```yaml
layout: banner
```

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `banner` | Full-width image banner with title overlaid. |
| `hero` | Large image above the article content. |
| `featured` | Image floated beside content. |
| `background` | Image behind the entire article. Forces dark mode for the page. |
| `columns` | Two-column layout with image. |
| `featured-columns-left` | Image on left, content on right. |
| `featured-columns-right` | Content on left, image on right. |
| *(not set)* | If `image.src` is set but no layout is specified, defaults to `background`. Otherwise, a plain text article. |

---

## Image

Controls the article's featured image. Used by all layout types and by masonry cards on the homepage.

```yaml
image:
  src: hero.jpg
  alt: "Descriptive text for accessibility"
  caption: "Photo credit or description"
  opacity: 0.7
  blur: 3px
  position: "center top"
  size: cover
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `src` | - | Image filename. Must be in the same page bundle directory. |
| `alt` | title | Alt text for accessibility. Falls back to caption, then title. |
| `caption` | - | Caption displayed below the image (banner and hero layouts). |
| `opacity` | site default | Image opacity override for this page. `1.0` = full image, lower = darker. |
| `blur` | site default | Blur override for this page. |
| `position` | `center center` | CSS `object-position` / `background-position` for image cropping. |
| `size` | `cover` | CSS `background-size` for background layout. |

### Card-specific image overrides

Different images or crops can be specified for cards and carousel:

```yaml
image:
  src: hero.jpg              # used on the article page
  card_src: card-crop.jpg    # used on masonry cards instead
  card_position: center top  # crop position on cards
  carousel_src: wide.jpg     # used on carousel cards instead
  carousel_position: center  # crop position on carousel
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `card_src` | Alternative image for masonry cards. Falls back to `src`. |
| `card_position` | CSS position for the card image. Falls back to `position`. |
| `carousel_src` | Alternative image for carousel cards. Falls back to `card_src`, then `src`. |
| `carousel_position` | CSS position for the carousel image. Falls back to `card_position`, then `position`. |

---

## Wash overrides

Per-page overrides for the wash (tinted overlay behind text). These override the site-level `params.wash` and `params.banner.wash` settings.

### Background-layout wash

```yaml
image:
  wash:
    opacity: 0.4
    blur: 2px
    gradient: "10% 20% 10% 20%"
```

### Banner-layout wash

```yaml
image:
  banner_wash:
    opacity: 0.4
    blur: 3px
    gradient: "25% 35% 25% 35%"
```

---

## Video

Embeds a Cloudflare Stream video in hero or columns layouts.

```yaml
video:
  id: "abc123def456"
  caption: "Video description"
  autoplay: true
  muted: true
  loop: true
  controls: true
  preload: true
  starttime: 5
  primarycolor: "#ff6600"
  letterboxcolor: "#000000"
  poster_image: "thumbnail.jpg"
  width: 1920
  height: 1080
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | - | Cloudflare Stream video ID. Required. |
| `caption` | - | Caption displayed below the video. |
| `autoplay` | site default | Auto-play on page load. |
| `muted` | site default | Start with audio muted. |
| `loop` | site default | Loop playback continuously. |
| `controls` | site default | Show player controls. |
| `preload` | site default | Preload video data before play. |
| `starttime` | - | Start playback at this time (seconds). |
| `primarycolor` | - | Player UI primary colour. |
| `letterboxcolor` | - | Colour of letterbox bars. |
| `poster_image` | - | Custom poster/thumbnail. Can be a filename (relative to page bundle), a site-root path (`/images/poster.jpg`), or a full URL. |
| `width` | auto-detected | Video width for aspect ratio calculation. |
| `height` | auto-detected | Video height for aspect ratio calculation. |

**Precedence:** Page frontmatter overrides site-level `cloudflareStream.videoDefaults`. Omitting a field falls through to the site default; omitting both lets Cloudflare apply its own default.

**Aspect ratio** is resolved in order: frontmatter `width`/`height` > `data/video-inventory.yaml` > Cloudflare Stream API (requires env vars) > 16:9 CSS fallback.

**Note:** Video is not supported in `banner` or `background` layouts. Hugo emits a warning if attempted.

---

## Homepage controls

### Pin

Pins a page to the top of the homepage masonry grid for its section.

```yaml
pin: 10
```

Lower numbers appear first. Pages without `pin` appear after all pinned pages, sorted by date.

### Carousel

Adds a page to the rotating carousel above the masonry grid.

```yaml
carousel: 1
```

Lower numbers appear first. A page can have both `carousel` and `pin` - it appears in the carousel and is excluded from the grid to avoid duplication.

---

## Display options

```yaml
hideDate: true
hideAuthor: true
toc: true
tocTitle: "Contents"
tldr: "A one-sentence summary shown at the top of the article."
contentLang: ga
linkTitle: "Short Label"
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `hideDate` | `false` | Hides the publication date on cards and article pages. |
| `hideAuthor` | `false` | Hides the author name. |
| `toc` | `false` | Enables a table of contents sidebar. Set to `true` or a string (used as the ToC heading). |
| `tocTitle` | `"Contents"` | Custom heading for the table of contents. |
| `tldr` | - | Summary box displayed at the top of the article. |
| `contentLang` | - | Language code (e.g. `ga` for Irish). Applies language-specific font styling. |
| `linkTitle` | `title` | Short label shown in auto-generated navigation contexts: sidebar, breadcrumb (both top-section and sub-section segments), and related-articles strips. The page's own `<h1>` and `<title>` tag continue to use `title`. Use this when a long SEO-oriented `title` would clutter a sidebar or breadcrumb. Hugo built-in (`.LinkTitle` falls back to `.Title` when unset, so pages without `linkTitle` are unaffected). |

---

## Signpost (call to action)

Displays a prominent call-to-action link on the article page.

```yaml
signpost:
  text: "BUY THE BOOK"
  url: "https://example.com/book"

signpost_footer:
  text: "VIEW ON GITHUB"
  url: "https://github.com/example"
```

`signpost` appears near the top of the article. `signpost_footer` appears at the bottom.

Also rendered, in the same positions, on **section index pages** (`_index.md`) that use `list_style: prose` (see [Section index fields](#section-index-fields)). The signposts bracket the `.Content` body the same way as on article pages.

---

## Display title

Overrides the rendered title without changing the page's metadata title.

```yaml
displayTitle: "A *Formatted* Title"
```

Supports inline Markdown formatting (bold, italic).

---

## Breadcrumb

Controls breadcrumb navigation on the article page.

```yaml
breadcrumb: false
```

Set to `false` to hide breadcrumbs on a specific page. Breadcrumbs are shown by default.

---

## Gallery mode

For image collection pages (e.g. photography galleries).

```yaml
gallery: true
featured_image: "hero.jpg"
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `gallery` | `true` enables gallery card rendering (image-dominant with text overlay). |
| `featured_image` | The image from the page bundle to use as the card thumbnail. |

---

## Section index fields

These fields go in `_index.md` files (branch bundles) that define sections.

```yaml
---
title: Photography
description: "A collection of images"
list_style: cards
list_recursive: true
sidebar: true
grid:
  columns:
    xl: 6
---
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `list_style` | `cards` | How pages in this section are listed. Options: `cards` (masonry grid), `list` (list view), `gallery` (gallery grid), `prose` (free-form landing page — see below). |
| `list_recursive` | `false` | Include pages from sub-sections in the listing. |
| `sidebar` | `false` | Show a sidebar on the section listing page. |
| `grid` | site default | Per-section grid configuration override (see [Configuration Reference](config.md#grid-configuration)). |

### `list_style: prose`

A free-form landing-page layout. The page renders only its `.Content` body — no carousel, no masonry grid, no pagination. Optional `signpost` and `signpost_footer` frontmatter render above and below the body (same partials as on article pages). Authors compose the page with shortcodes inside the body — testimonials via `quote`, stats rows via `stats`, hero copy as prose.

Applies to both the root homepage (`content/_index.md`) and any section index page (`content/<section>/_index.md`).

```yaml
---
title: "About"
list_style: prose
signpost:
  text: "GET IN TOUCH"
  url: /contact/
signpost_footer:
  text: "READ THE JOURNAL"
  url: /journal/
---

A consultancy practice. Three decades across financial services and the public sector.

{{< stats >}}
{{< stat number="20" suffix="+" label="Years experience" >}}
{{< stat number="80" label="Countries advised" >}}
{{< /stats >}}

## What clients say

{{< quote name="A. Client" role="Director" organization="Example Co" featured=true >}}
Clarity where there was none.
{{< /quote >}}
```

See `exampleSite/content/profile/_index.md` for a live demo.

---

## Build control

```yaml
_build:
  list: false
```

Setting `_build.list: false` excludes a page from section listings and the homepage grid while keeping the page itself accessible via its URL. Useful for pages linked only from the carousel or navigation.

---

## Full example

```yaml
---
title: "The Cartographer"
date: 2025-11-10
description: "A poem about maps and the places they miss."
tags:
  - poetry
  - maps
author: "Author Name"
layout: hero
pin: 80
carousel: 1
image:
  src: hero.jpg
  alt: "Antique map with compass rose"
  caption: "Where the roads used to run"
  card_position: center top
signpost:
  text: "READ THE COLLECTION"
  url: /poetry/
toc: true
---
```

## Changelog

- **1.1** (2026-05-12): #54 documentation.

Added `list_style: prose` to the Section Index Fields section with a dedicated subsection and full example (#54 item 2 — free-form landing-page layout). Noted that `signpost` and `signpost_footer` also render on `list_style: prose` section pages, bracketing `.Content` the same way as on article pages.
- **1.0** (2026-05-05): Initial frontmatter reference covering basic fields, layouts, image/video, homepage controls, signpost, display title, breadcrumb, gallery, section-index, and build control.
