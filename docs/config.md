# Configuration Reference

All configuration lives in `hugo.yaml` (or `hugo.toml` / `hugo.json`) under the `params` key. Every parameter has a sensible hardcoded default - a site works with no `params` block at all.

---

## Pre-release gate

Hides the site behind a passphrase prompt. The page renders fully but stays invisible until the visitor enters the correct passphrase. Not a security feature - the passphrase is checked client-side as a SHA-256 hash - just enough to keep a work-in-progress site out of search indexes and casual browsing.

```yaml
params:
  prereleaseKey: "your-passphrase-here"
```

When unset (or empty), no prompt is shown and the site behaves normally. When set, every page prompts on first visit; the result is stored in `localStorage` so the visitor is not re-prompted on subsequent navigation.

The visitor sees `prompt('This site is not yet public. Enter passphrase:')`. Wrong passphrase or cancel redirects to `about:blank`.

---

## Ambience (colour mode)

Controls the site's light/dark mode behaviour.

```yaml
params:
  ambience:
    default: auto       # auto | light | dark
    toggle: true        # show the user a light/dark toggle button
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `default` | `auto` | Starting colour mode. `auto` follows the user's OS preference. `light` and `dark` force a fixed mode. |
| `toggle` | `true` | Whether to display a toggle button in the header. When `false`, the user cannot switch modes. |

**Note:** The previous `mode` parameter (`light`/`dark`/`auto`/`toggle`) is deprecated and ignored from v1.0.1. Use `ambience` instead.

---

## Spoiler masks

Controls the visibility of the symbol pattern used in place of concealed spoiler text.

```yaml
params:
  spoiler:
    opacity: 0.38
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `opacity` | `0.38` | Opacity of concealed inline and block spoiler symbols. The symbols inherit the surrounding text colour, including downstream theme overrides and dark layouts. |

The setting changes opacity only. It does not assign a spoiler text colour.

---

## Background image defaults

Controls how images appear behind text - on background-layout articles, masonry cards, carousel cards, and list views. Images are always placed on a dark backing. Lowering opacity lets the dark backing show through, darkening the image for text readability.

```yaml
params:
  bgImage:
    opacity: 0.7         # image opacity (0.0-1.0). Lower = darker.
    blur: 2px            # blur applied to the image
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `opacity` | `0.7` | How transparent the image is. `1.0` = full image, `0.5` = half the dark backing shows through. |
| `blur` | `2px` | Gaussian blur on the image. Higher values soften the image for text readability. |

These are the base defaults. More specific contexts (cards, carousel, banner) fall back to these values when their own are not set.

---

## Card image settings

Controls images on masonry cards (the homepage grid).

```yaml
params:
  cardImage:
    opacity: 0.9         # card image opacity (falls back to bgImage.opacity)
    blur: 2px            # card image blur (falls back to bgImage.blur)
    showAuthor: true     # show author name on card meta
    title:
      wash:
        opacity: 0.2     # title wash tint strength
        blur: 5px        # title wash backdrop blur
        gradientV: "10%" # vertical gradient fade at edges
        gradientH: "10%" # horizontal gradient fade at edges
    description:
      wash:
        opacity: 0.35    # bottom scrim max opacity
        coverage: "50%"  # how much of the card the scrim covers, from the bottom up
        gradient: "50%"  # what % of the scrim area is fade (0% = hard edge, 100% = all fade)
        blur: 5px        # backdrop blur behind the scrim
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `opacity` | inherits `bgImage.opacity` | Image opacity on cards. |
| `blur` | inherits `bgImage.blur` | Image blur on cards. |
| `showAuthor` | `true` | Show the author name in the card meta strip. |

### Title wash

A soft-edged tinted layer behind the card title text. Uses gradient masking so the edges dissolve into the image rather than showing a hard box.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `title.wash.opacity` | `0.2` | Tint strength behind the title. |
| `title.wash.blur` | `5px` | Backdrop blur behind the title. |
| `title.wash.gradientV` | `10%` | How far the vertical fade extends inward from each edge. Higher = more fade. |
| `title.wash.gradientH` | `10%` | How far the horizontal fade extends inward from each edge. |

### Description wash

A bottom-up gradient scrim behind the card excerpt/description area.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `description.wash.opacity` | `0.35` | Maximum opacity at the bottom of the scrim. |
| `description.wash.coverage` | `50%` | What share of the card the scrim covers, measured from the bottom up. |
| `description.wash.gradient` | `50%` | What share of the scrim area is fade. `0%` = hard edge, `100%` = pure fade. |
| `description.wash.blur` | `5px` | Backdrop blur behind the scrim. |

---

## Gallery card image settings

Controls images on gallery/artwork masonry cards. These show the full image at 100% opacity with no blur (the image is the content), so the title and footer need stronger wash treatment.

```yaml
params:
  cardGalleryImage:
    title:
      wash:
        opacity: 0.2     # title wash tint strength
        blur: 5px        # title wash backdrop blur
        gradientV: "10%" # vertical gradient fade at edges
        gradientH: "10%" # horizontal gradient fade at edges
    description:
      wash:
        opacity: 0.35    # footer scrim max opacity
        coverage: "20%"  # how much of the card the scrim covers, from the bottom up
        gradient: "50%"  # what % of scrim area is fade
        blur: 5px        # backdrop blur behind the scrim
```

The same `title.wash` and `description.wash` keys as regular cards (see above) apply here. The defaults differ to suit image-dominant cards.

---

## Carousel settings

Controls the rotating hero card above the masonry grid on the homepage.

```yaml
params:
  carousel:
    interval: 6          # seconds between slides
    showAuthor: true     # show author name on carousel meta
    bgImage:
      opacity: 0.9       # carousel image opacity (falls back to bgImage.opacity)
      blur: 0px          # carousel image blur (falls back to bgImage.blur)
    title:
      wash:
        opacity: 0.2     # title wash tint strength
        blur: 5px        # title wash backdrop blur
        gradientV: "10%" # vertical gradient fade at edges
        gradientH: "10%" # horizontal gradient fade at edges
    description:
      wash:
        opacity: 0.3     # bottom scrim max opacity
        coverage: "35%"  # how much of the card the scrim covers, from the bottom up
        gradient: "50%"  # what % of scrim area is fade
        blur: 5px        # backdrop blur behind the scrim
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `interval` | `6` | Seconds between automatic slide transitions. |
| `showAuthor` | `true` | Show the author name on carousel meta. |
| `bgImage.opacity` | inherits `bgImage.opacity` | Image opacity on carousel cards. |
| `bgImage.blur` | inherits `bgImage.blur` | Image blur on carousel cards. |
| `title.wash.opacity` | `0.2` | Tint strength behind the carousel title. |
| `title.wash.blur` | `5px` | Backdrop blur behind the carousel title. |
| `title.wash.gradientV` | `10%` | Vertical fade distance. |
| `title.wash.gradientH` | `10%` | Horizontal fade distance. |
| `description.wash.opacity` | `0.3` | Maximum opacity at the bottom of the scrim. |
| `description.wash.coverage` | `35%` | What share of the card the scrim covers, from the bottom up. |
| `description.wash.gradient` | `50%` | What share of the scrim area is fade. |
| `description.wash.blur` | `5px` | Backdrop blur behind the scrim. |

---

## Background-layout wash

Controls the tinted overlay behind text panels on background-layout article pages. This is the wash that makes body text readable over a full-page background image.

```yaml
params:
  wash:
    opacity: 0.25              # tint strength (0 = none, 1 = solid)
    blur: 0px                  # backdrop blur behind text panels
    gradient: "0% 10% 0% 10%"  # edge fade: left top right bottom
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `opacity` | `0.25` | Dark tint strength behind text panels. |
| `blur` | `0px` | Backdrop blur applied to text panels. |
| `gradient` | `0% 10% 0% 10%` | How far the wash fades at each edge (left, top, right, bottom). Higher values = more fade. Accepts 1, 2, or 4 values. |

Per-page override: set `image.wash` in frontmatter (see [Frontmatter Reference](frontmatter.md)).

---

## Banner wash

Controls the tinted overlay behind the title on banner-layout pages.

```yaml
params:
  banner:
    wash:
      opacity: 0.3                 # wash tint strength
      blur: 2px                    # backdrop blur
      gradient: "20% 30% 20% 30%"  # edge fade: left top right bottom
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `opacity` | `0.3` | Dark tint strength behind the banner title. |
| `blur` | `2px` | Backdrop blur behind the title area. |
| `gradient` | `20% 30% 20% 30%` | Edge fade distances. Banner uses heavier fade than background-layout to avoid a visible box over the image. |

Per-page override: set `image.banner_wash` in frontmatter (see [Frontmatter Reference](frontmatter.md)).

---

## Heading prefixes

Controls the decorative character or symbol displayed before headings in each context.

```yaml
params:
  headingPrefix:
    card: "#"            # masonry card titles (homepage and section grids)
    carousel: "#"        # carousel card titles (rotating hero)
    list: ""             # list-view items (sections with list_style: list)
    page: "#"            # article page title (banner, hero, etc.)
    sectionTitle: "#"    # section page titles (e.g. /blog/, /poetry/)
    h1: "#"              # body content: heading level 1
    h2: "##"             # body content: heading level 2
    h3: "###"            # body content: heading level 3
    h4: "####"           # body content: heading level 4
    h5: "#####"          # body content: heading level 5
    h6: "######"         # body content: heading level 6
```

Set any value to `""` to suppress the prefix entirely (no glyph, no spacing).

`h1`-`h6` apply to headings *inside* article body content (`# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`, etc. in markdown). `page` applies to the article's main title (the page header).

Supports any text, Unicode character, or emoji.

---

## List bullet glyph

Controls the glyph rendered before each `<li>` in unordered lists across the entire site.

```yaml
params:
  listBullet: '•'   # default
```

Distinct from `headingPrefix.list`: that controls section-page list-view *item titles* (when a section uses `list_style: list`), whereas `listBullet` controls the bullet on every `<ul><li>` in body content.

Typographic note: the keyboard `*` (U+002A ASTERISK) is designed to sit at cap-height for footnote use and looks superscripted in proportional fonts. If an asterisk-shaped bullet is desired, prefer `✱` (U+2731 HEAVY ASTERISK), which is vertically centred to x-height.

Supports any text, Unicode character, or emoji.

---

## Print stylesheet

Print rendering is built in and requires no configuration. A dedicated stylesheet (`assets/css/print.css`) is loaded with `media="print"`, so it is only downloaded when the browser's print pipeline triggers.

Print output:

- Forces black text on white paper regardless of the active screen ambience (light/dark/auto).
- Hides site chrome and interactive widgets (navigation, footer, lightbox overlay, burger menu, ambience toggle, sidebars, pagination, contact-form widgets, carousel arrows, embedded video/iframes).
- Retains editorial content: article title, author, date, breadcrumb text, TOC, signposts (with their URL expanded inline), related-articles list, post tags, and the `section-list` shortcode output.
- Resizes content images responsively to print orientation: in portrait, no wider than 70% of page width and no taller than 30% of page height; in landscape, the constraints invert.
- Sets body text to Asap 12pt (weight 400; bold 800). Headings (Special Elite), pull-quotes (IM Fell Extended), and code (IosevkaCustom Extended) retain their screen typefaces.
- Force-opens any `<details>` collapsibles so their content is visible on paper.
- Expands external `http(s)` link URLs after the anchor text; internal anchors and relative links remain plain.
- Applies sensible page breaks: headings stay with the following content; callouts, pull-quotes, code blocks, tables, and figures are not split across pages.

No author action is required to opt in. Cmd+P (or "Save as PDF") on any page produces a reader-view-style output across every layout the theme supports.

---

## Read more button

Controls the "read more" indicator on masonry cards.

```yaml
params:
  readMore:
    type: icon                              # "icon" or "text"
    value: icons/chevron-right-duo-thick.svg # icon path or text string
    valueDark: ""                            # optional dark-mode variant icon
```

---

## Site logo

The site logo appears in the header. Two variants can be provided for light and dark modes.

```yaml
params:
  mainImage: /images/logo-light.svg       # logo for light mode
  mainImageDark: /images/logo-dark.svg    # logo for dark mode (optional)
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `mainImage` | - | Path to the logo image. When set, replaces the text site title in the header. |
| `mainImageDark` | - | Alternate logo shown in dark mode. Falls back to `mainImage` if absent. |

When neither is set, the site title is rendered as text.

---

## Open Graph image

Default Open Graph image used in social media previews when a page does not provide its own `image.src`.

```yaml
params:
  og_image: /images/social-card.jpg
```

Per-page `image.src` (in frontmatter) takes precedence.

---

## Content width

Controls the maximum width of the page content (article body, masonry grid, etc.).

```yaml
params:
  contentMaxWidth: 80rem      # caps article body and grid width
```

Default `80rem`. Affects both article pages and section list pages uniformly.

---

## Grid configuration

Controls the responsive masonry grid layout.

```yaml
params:
  grid:
    sidebarWidth: 15rem
    sidebarWidthNarrow: 12rem
    gap: 1.5rem
    breakpoints:
      sm: 30em
      md: 48em
      lg: 64em
      xl: 80em
    columns:
      sm: 2
      md: 3
      lg: 4
      xl: 5
```

(`grid.contentMaxWidth` is still accepted as a legacy alias for `contentMaxWidth`.)

All values above are the defaults. Per-section overrides are supported via `grid` in section `_index.md` frontmatter.

---

## Cloudflare Stream (video)

Configuration for video embedding via Cloudflare Stream.

```yaml
params:
  cloudflareStream:
    customerCode: "abc123"         # Cloudflare customer subdomain code (required)
    videoDefaults:
      autoplay: false
      muted: true
      loop: false
      controls: true
      preload: false
      primarycolor: "#ff6600"
      letterboxcolor: "#000000"
```

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `customerCode` | The customer subdomain code from Cloudflare Stream. Required for video playback. |
| `videoDefaults.*` | Site-wide defaults for video player behaviour. Per-page frontmatter overrides these. See [Frontmatter Reference](frontmatter.md#video) for all fields. |

---

## Table of contents

Default heading for the table of contents on pages where `toc: true` is set in frontmatter.

```yaml
params:
  tocTitle: "Contents"
```

Default `"Table of contents:"`. Override per-page by setting `tocTitle` (or a string value for `toc:`) in frontmatter.

---

## Social links

Displayed as icons in the footer.

```yaml
params:
  social:
    - name: GitHub
      icon: github                    # Feather icon (default)
      url: https://github.com/username
    - name: BlueSky
      icon: "simple:bluesky"          # Simple Icons (simple: prefix)
      url: https://bsky.app/profile/username
    - name: RSS
      icon: rss
      url: /index.xml
```

Icons can be Feather icons (bare name) or Simple Icons (prefixed with `simple:`).

---

## Footer text links

Plain-text links shown alongside the social icons in the footer (e.g. legal pages, contact, colophon).

```yaml
params:
  footerLinks:
    - name: About
      url: /about/
    - name: Colophon
      url: /colophon/
```

Rendered as `· name · name` between the copyright text and the social icons.

---

## Taxonomy listing filter

Controls which page types appear in tag and term listings.

```yaml
params:
  excludedTypes:
    - page
```

Default `["page"]` (pages of type `page` are excluded from tag/term listings, so standalone pages like `/about/` do not clutter tag pages). Override to include or exclude more types as needed.

---

## Other settings

```yaml
params:
  browserTitle: "Custom Browser Tab Title"  # overrides site title in <title> only
  description: "Default meta description"   # fallback site-wide meta description
  dateFormat: "2 January 2006"              # Go date format for article pages
  dateFormatShort: "02/01/06"               # short format for cards
  subtitle: "A tagline for the site"
  useCDN: false                             # true to load icons from CDN
  mathjax: false                            # enable MathJax maths rendering
  katex: false                              # enable KaTeX maths rendering
  favicon: /favicon.ico                     # path to favicon

  mainSections:                             # sections shown on homepage
    - blog
    - gallery
    - poetry

  # Hugo's content model requires sections to be branch bundles
  # (directories with _index.md and child pages). A leaf bundle
  # (a single index.md with no children) is not a section - Hugo
  # does not expose it as one, so the homepage grid cannot find it.

  customCSS:                                # additional CSS files
    - css/custom.css
    - css/fonts.css

  customJS:                                 # additional JavaScript files
    - js/lightbox.js
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `browserTitle` | site `title` | Overrides the site title in the `<title>` tag only. |
| `description` | - | Fallback meta description used when a page has no `description` of its own. |
| `dateFormat` | `2 January 2006` | Go date format for full article pages. |
| `dateFormatShort` | `:date_medium` | Short date format for cards and lists. |
| `subtitle` | - | Optional tagline rendered on the homepage. Supports Markdown. |
| `useCDN` | `false` | When `true`, load Simple Icons from jsDelivr CDN instead of local copy. |
| `mathjax` | `false` | Enable MathJax for maths rendering. |
| `katex` | `false` | Enable KaTeX for maths rendering. |
| `favicon` | - | Path to favicon. Supports `.png`, `.svg`, `.ico`. |
| `mainSections` | `["blog"]` | Sections to feature on the homepage masonry grid. |
| `customCSS` | - | Additional CSS files loaded after the theme styles. |
| `customJS` | - | Additional JavaScript files loaded in the head. |
